# Golem JS Preview Program

Welcome to the Golem JS Preview Program repository! 

It contains a set of tasks based on the Golem JS SDK. By completing them you will learn how to write JS applications that will execute your tasks on the Golem Network. 

The program is based on the latest @golem-sdk/golem-js library and our new [documentation](https://docs.golem.network/docs/creators/javascript). 

To participate in the program and win prizes you must be recruited for one of the program rounds. Even if we do not run the program at the given moment, you are welcome to use the tasks to facilitate your tour with Golem and JS SDK. We would appreciate your feedback to help us improve the Golem Network, JS SDK, and docs.

If you encounter any issues during the work on the tasks ask on the 
[Discord](https://chat.golem.network/) `#js-discussion` channel in the SDK section. 

We also encourage you to visit https://www.golem.network/, where you can find more information about our open-source project.

**What is the Golem Network?**

The Golem Network is a flexible and open-source platform that harnesses the power of decentralization for accessing and sharing computational resources.
We are building a new open-source world that everyone has the right to enter. 

**Our new Golem JS SDK lets you:**

- Develop distributed open-source computing solutions for a wide range of use cases.
- Run tasks on the Golem Network directly from your browser.
- Create serverless applications using Golem as your computation backend.
